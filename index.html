      <h1>Hi! <span>My name is Esther</span></h1>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a bilingual Computer Engineering student with hands-on experience in C, C++, Python, and Verilog. Iâ€™ve worked on embedded systems using Raspberry Pi, and Iâ€™m familiar with tools like Git and Vivado. My background in customer service has sharpened my communication and teamwork skills, and Iâ€™m excited to bring both my technical and interpersonal strengths into real-world engineering projects.

  <!-- ABOUT ME SECTION -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a first-generation Mexican-American student pursuing Computer Engineering, and everything I do is driven by purpose and pride. Growing up, I didnâ€™t have engineers in my family â€” but I had curiosity, grit, and the kind of work ethic that doesnâ€™t quit. Iâ€™ve had to figure a lot out on my own, but thatâ€™s exactly what made me resilient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether itâ€™s debugging code at 2AM, wiring up circuits, or helping my siblings with homework, Iâ€™ve always believed in pushing forward no matter how tough it gets. Engineering isnâ€™t just something I study â€” itâ€™s how I build a future Iâ€™m proud of. One that breaks cycles, uplifts my community, and shows other first-gen kids that we belong here too.
